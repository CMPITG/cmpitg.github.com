In descending order of priority:

## Scripting ##

* newLISP and Racket (for personal use)
* Ruby and Python (for deployment)

## General Purposes ##

* Racket
* Clojure (when making use of huge Java ecosystem)
* Ruby and Python
* JavaScript (for speed)
* Pascal (size, speed, and safety)

## Education ##

* Pascal
* Smalltalk
* Racket (for Lispers only)

## GUI programming ##

N/A

I'm doing research on Racket's GUI capabilities.  Current there are several
unordered choices: Racket, Python PyQt PySide, Clojure with SWT.

## Random notes ##

Unreferenced, biased personal arguments and immediate notes.

### Why not C or C++? ###

* Noisy and dirty.

* Might be good for performance reasons, but extremely bad for maintenance.

* Writing good C/C++ is no trivial matter.

* Complex, carelessly written toolsets.

* Bad coders everywhere.

* Bad standards.

### Why not Haskell? ###

* Writing good Haskell is no trivial matter.

* Optimization is particularly hard.

* Large projects tend to lose its cleanliness.
