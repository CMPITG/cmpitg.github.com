## The LightTable experiment ##

### Reasoning ###

* I always want a better system than Emacs:
  - More beautiful
  - Supports concurrent programming
  - Uses a better Lisp (Clojure **is** a **better** Lisp, from my personal
    view)
  - Flexible in displaying things (like in a browser)
  - Better code base.

* LightTable is a great tool to experiment cool ideas:
  - Quick to prototype
  - Live-experiment

* Chris Granger is not satisfied with what we have in programming.

So I decided to begin experimenting LightTable in all ways possible, starting
with this page.  I'll try to keep this page as concise as helpful as possible.
