Học sử là để có cái mà không bất cứ con chuột hiện đại nào nhấp ra được cho ta: nhận ra được biện chứng lạ lùng và tất yếu của lịch sử, để mà biết làm người cho xứng đáng người, làm công dân độc lập, tự chủ, sáng tạo, đầy trách nhiệm của nước Việt và của thế giới. Đặc biệt hôm nay, khi vận mệnh Tổ quốc một lần nữa lại đứng trước thử thách lớn." - Worth revisited!
