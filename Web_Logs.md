* [Clojure - Lamina Channels](https://github.com/ztellman/lamina/wiki/Channels)
* [Clojure - Pipelines](https://github.com/ztellman/lamina/wiki/Pipelines) (Worth revisited several times) - To some extent, the idea of pipeline is very much like Haskell's Monad
* [Back on Linux](http://dywypi.org/2012/02/back-on-linux.html)
* [Why I left Perl](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2012/02/why-i-left-perl/) - Quick thoughts: It's not that we don't understand Perl, pal, it's *Perl guys don't understand us*, and no nothing or little about programming paradigms, or the way human brain works, or the answer to the question: when programming, who are the slaves?  And you are taking things too personal.
* [Don't say you weren't warned](http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2012/02/dont_say_you_we.php)
* [Path uploads your entire iPhone address book to its servers](http://mclov.in/2012/02/08/path-uploads-your-entire-address-book-to-their-servers.html) - For those who trust iPhone and closed source.  I'm not sure how you feel with comments like "This is a good alternative solution", "This is currently the industry best practice", "if you would like ... please contact ...".
* [Hashing for privacy in social apps](http://mattgemmell.com/2012/02/11/hashing-for-privacy-in-social-apps/)
* [Why are ugly websites so successful?](http://www.gerrymcgovern.com/nt/2012/nt-2012-02-13-Why-ugly.htm) - I don't understand the this fellow's definition of "ugly", and his perspective is one-sided.  From my point of view, if a website *remains* ugly (by that I mean really horribly designed), they don't respect the readers.
* [Clojure - Connections](https://github.com/ztellman/lamina/wiki/Connections)

### Thu, 16 Feb 2012 +0700

* [They Write the Right Stuff](http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/06/writestuff.html)
* [The Problem With µ-Frameworks](http://rawsyntax.com/blog/the-problem-with-micro-frameworks/) (He has the point, and it's different from my thoughts about the pros and cons of complexity management)

### Tue, 14 Feb 2012 +0700

* [The Fastest Webserver?](http://www.webperformance.com/load-testing/blog/2011/11/what-is-the-fastest-webserver/) - One of the stupidest performance benchmarks I've ever read.  What OS version and architecture? Running Apache, Lighttpd, Nginx on M$ Windows?  Single static-page serving?  No clear benchmarking tool?  Oh come on!  I doubt if he knows anything about benchmarking at all.
* [The key value store everyone ignored (Postgresql)](http://blog.creapptives.com/post/14062057061/the-key-value-store-everyone-ignored-postgresql)

* [Are You a Zen Coder or Distraction-Junkie?](http://www.componentowl.com/blog/2012/02/zen-coder-vs-distraction-junkie/) - Try not paying attention to all the *DotNot* stuff (and no, that's not a typo).
