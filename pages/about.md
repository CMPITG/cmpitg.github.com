My name is *Nguyễn Hà Dương*, also known as Duong “Yang” Nguyen in English, グエンヤン in Japanese, and simply *cmpitg*. Please call me "Yang" if you hate pronouncing the word :-). I'm a FOSS activist in Vietnam, where I do software development, promote the sharing culture and provide support for both users and contributors. I'm a greedy person with a wide range of interest in FOSS projects: Mozilla (as a [Mozilla Rep](https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Cmpitg)), Fedora (also as [Fedora Ambassador](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Cmpitg)), Node.js, SpiderMonkey, ... :-).

Besides being a member of some FOSS communites (which of course you don't want me to miss HanoiLUG), I and a bunch of FOSS guys have founded [Hanoi Community Space](http://khonggiancongdong.org) - a FOSS working group and community model to promote the **philosophy and culture** of Free and Open Source Software, as well as to **bring value** to anyone who is a part of the ecosystem - in in March 2012. [Join us](https://groups.google.com/group/khonggian-congdong) if you are interested!

To make my life more thrilled, I have developed [RSI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury) since July 2012. My life as a computer addict has never been more annoying. Oh well, it's a hack after all.

My name is *Nguyễn Hà Dương*, also known as Duong “Yang” Nguyen in English, グエンヤン in Japanese, and simply *cmpitg*. I have been working as a freelancer since 2006. I also worked for several companies in the past (all of them were not open source) and now happily reside in [iWay](http://iwayvietnam.com). I am a member of HanoiLUG (Hanoi Linux User Group), Ubuntu-VN, OLPC Vietnam. My main contributor lies in Mozilla and Fedora projects. I have been a [Fedora Ambassador](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Cmpitg) and [Mozilla Rep](https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Cmpitg) since 2012.

## In Programming

I collect programming languages as my hobby. I love and strongly believe in the art of designing programs. No matter how difficult a problem is, *programmers should always be the masters*.

## In Other IT Stuff

I am a hardcore GNU/Linux system administrator. The first time I used GNU/Linux was in 2005, when I received a Ubuntu CD freely distributed in my school. I officially changed from Microsoft Windows® to GNU/Linux in 2008 and tried as many \*nix distrubutions as I can.

- In 2005: Ubuntu
- From mid 2005 to mid 2006: Slackware and Fedora
- In second half of 2006: Debian GNU/Linux
- From 2007 to mid 2008: openSUSE and Fedora
- From 2009 to 2012: FreeBSD
- From 2009 to present (2012): Ubuntu and Fedora
- From early 2010 to Jun 2011: Arch Linux
- From early 2010 to the end of 2011, 2012 to present (2012): Debian GNU/Linux (again, for the desktop at home)
- From mid 2010 to Jun 2011: OpenBSD
- From mid 2010 to present (2012): Gentoo GNU/Linux, as my main system.

I’m a language, keyboard, and typeface lover. I speak Vietnamese (native), English (fluent), French (intermediate), Japanese (intermediate), and a bit of Spanish. I used to be an advanced Vim user but officially changed to Emacs in 2010 when I found Vim did not fit all my need. I’m left-handed and a loyal Programmer Dvorak user.

Currently (2012), I’m using Awesome as my main window manager. I love beautiful fonts. I have sought (and now still seeking) for the most gorgeous fonts and alter them regularly.

Recommended Programming Languages

    Wildly encouraged: Clojure, Haskell, Ruby, Go-lang, Shen (immature). Suitable for virtually everything, from general-purpose tasks to domain-specific tasks.
    Strongly encouraged:
        For scripting: newLISP, Python, Shen.
        General-purpose: Smalltalk, Qi, Ruby, Python, Shen.
        For concurrent programming: Erlang, Scala, Clojure, newLISP.
        Lightweight and fast: newLISP, Lua.
        For Embedded systems: Lua.
        Network-related: JavaScript, Clojure, Scala, newLISP.
        Good asbtraction: JavaScript, Scala, Lua, Qi, Shen, Prolog.
    Encouraged: Scheme, Awk, Objective-C, Common Lisp.
    Discouraged: PHP, Visual Basic.
    Strongly discouraged:
        Verbose, noisy, dangerous, encouraging bad programming practices: C++, Java, Perl, SQL.
        Slow: Java, Perl, SQL.
        Confusing and stupidly designed: Java, Perl, C++, Common Lisp.
    Exceptions (both encouraged and discouraged): C, Assembly, Common Lisp.
    Notes:
        The worst features of newLISP, in my opinion, are the overuse of global symbols (namedly context, passed by reference), and lack of hashtable-like local data structure. I have written a quick-and-dirty dictionary/map/hashtable implementation for personal use at github.
        Racket is very noisy, especially when writing large programs.
        Python does not force programmers to do things conventionally. Its standardization process is inconsistent.
        Smalltalk and Ruby are very clear, declarative, and have best programming practices in the world. However, they are relatively slow compared to other general-purpose languages.
        Smalltalk’s documentation is very poor and not well-maintained, except for some basic books. (Check out Pharo by example)
        Been in documentation hell? Try Racket, Haskell, newLISP, Python!
        The ANSI Common Lisp standard is huge, overcomplicated, noisy, unconventional, inconsistent and really confusing. Common Lisp makes programmers slaves! However, it features many of the best programming paradigms, see Paul Graham’s Revenge of the Nerds.
