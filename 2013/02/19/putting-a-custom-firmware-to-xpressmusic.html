          <h2 id="foreword">Foreword</h2>
          <p>Last weekends, I settled things down, preparing for the first workweek of the
Lunar New Year, helping my brother putting a custom firmware on
his
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_5800_XpressMusic">Nokia 5800 XpressMusic</a>.
Bro is no tech addicted, but his interest in tech was enough for him to get
his hands dirty for these kinds of thing.</p>
          <p>Victory loves preparation, and flashing a firmware is a dangerous process.
Besides, my brother is a high-school student (no financial income), who has an
XpressMusic as his only phone, which means if he bricks it, he gotta manage to
get another one by himself.  The default Symbian version on his phone is a
bunch of crap, especially when it has something to do with the memory card,
with laggish performance and memory card corruption all the time.  Though
loving his phone, he really hates his OS.  He has this desire for replacing
the OS for a while, but after reading about the process and the consequences
(<em>bricking</em>) it might cause, he hesitated and merely gave up the idea.</p>
          <p>The time came up when our mother (sort of) offered him a chance for a
secondhand phone, with reasonable cost and lower hardware spec (‘cause that’s
all she and I could afford), and encouraged him to take a shot.  With my
support as his supervisor, he decided to spend his last holidays to flash his
phone.</p>
          <h2 id="the-preparation">The preparation</h2>
          <p>Some notes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Nokia Cooker and Nokia Firmware Editor serve the same purpose, so just use
one of them.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>We couldn’t install Phoenix because of the “dongle not found” crap.  Later I
found out we need to use the pirate version to get rid of it.  All forum
posts saying you should disable anti-virus software, … were written by
idiots, don’t trust them!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>JAF contains malware, so we used it in KVM virtual machine, running an
evaluation version of Windows, and deleted the whole VM when it’s done.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Basically, what we needed was a bunch of software:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.symbian-toys.com/nokiacooker.aspx">Nokia Cooker</a> - for modifying
firmware</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.nokiabreak.com/download-nokia-firmware-editor-v0-3.html">Nokia Firmware Editor</a> -
for modifying firmware</li>
            <li>JAF (link contains pirate software and malware, so I wouldn’t post it
here) - for flashing</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.cpkb.org/wiki/Nokia_Phoenix_Service_Software">Phoenix</a> - for
flashing, we didn’t use it though</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.symbian-toys.com/navifirm.aspx">Navifirm</a> - for downloading
original firmware</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.comms.ovi.com/m/p/ovi/suite/index_my_my.html">Nokia Ovi Suite</a> -
just for installing appropriate driver</li>
          </ul>
          <p>And firmwares:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.symbiantweet.com/idroid-custom-firmware-for-nokia-5800-updated-to-v9-1-4">iDroid 9.1.4</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.symbiantweet.com/nokia-belle-custom-firmware-for-nokia-5800">Nokia Belle</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.symbiantweet.com/symbian-anna-custom-firmware-v7-5-for-nokia-5800">Symbian Anna</a></li>
            <li>An <a href="http://symbianvn.net/showthread.php?t=19057">unnamed custom firmware (CFW) for 5800</a> found in a <a href="http://symbianvn.net/">Symbian VN forum</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>And tons of guides and tutorials, although most of them were crappy, sloppily
written!  I only found some <em>usable enough</em> and post them here:</p>
          <ul>

couldn’t have it installed.</p>

          <h2 id="the-process">The process</h2>
          <p>There were so much going on during session, so I would briefly describe what I
think was useful in a followable steps:</p>
          <h3 id="what-we-actually-used">What we actually used</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Nokia Firmware Editor, to put Vietnamese to the firmware,</li>
            <li>Nokia Ovi Suite, to install drivers,</li>
            <li>Navifirm, to download stock firmware,</li>
            <li>JAF, to flash.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Check our phone’s type: <code class="highlighter-rouge">*#0000#</code> -&gt; <em>RM-356</em>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Install Nokia Ovi Suite, putting in the device to have appropriate drivers
installed, then uninstall it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Install/run Navifirm, choose the right model (RM-356) and the right stock
firmware (Vietnam RED), download it and copy it to somewhere safe.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Create the folder: <code class="highlighter-rouge">%programfiles%\Nokia\phoenix\products\RM-356</code>, and copy
the downloaded firmware files to it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Run Nokia Firmware Editor:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Open the firmware containing Vietnamese (Vietnam RED and some other
firmwares we found), and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Extract</code>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Wait for the files to finish loading.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Go to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tools &gt; Language Manager</code> and export Vietnamese.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Open the <code class="highlighter-rouge">resources/fonts</code> folder in the explorer and copy to somewhere
safe.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Close and run Nokia Firmware Editor again.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Open the firmware to add Vietnamese, we did it several times, one with
each firmware:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><em>iDroid</em></li>
                    <li><em>Nokia Bell</em></li>
                    <li><em>Symbian Anna</em></li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Replace the <code class="highlighter-rouge">resources/fonts</code> with the version we’ve just copied.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Now <code class="highlighter-rouge">Repack/Rebuild</code> and close it.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Install JAF and run it:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Turn off the phone and connect it to the computer using the USB cable.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Go to the <em>BB5</em> tab.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Check <code class="highlighter-rouge">Manual Flash</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Dead USB</code>, choose <code class="highlighter-rouge">NORMAL</code> in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mode</code>, and leave
everything else unchecked.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Check <code class="highlighter-rouge">Use INI</code> and choose <em>RM-356</em>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Choose the appropriate product code.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Then <code class="highlighter-rouge">Flash</code>, confirm by <code class="highlighter-rouge">Yes</code>, then quickly hold the power button for <strong>1
second</strong> to turn of the phone.  The flashing process begins.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>When the message says <code class="highlighter-rouge">Done!</code>, disconnect it from the USB cable, take out
the battery and put it in.  Power on.  Then test our phone.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>We modified firmwares and flashed them (unmodified and modified version) for a
couple dozens times so we could find the best firmware for the device.</p>
          <h3 id="and-the-result">And the result</h3>
          <p><em>iDroid</em> is a EU RED version, which is incompatible with the Vietnam RED
model, causing boot loop and then frozen while booting.  That’s so unfortunate
as my brother expected it the most.  <em>Nokia Bell</em> couldn’t boot.  <em>Symbian
Anna</em> (Ukraine RED) worked well but having problems when displaying
Vietnamese.  We ended flashing the unnamed CFW and up to now it provides what
my brother needs just fine.</p>
          <h2 id="afterthought">Afterthought</h2>
          <p>This was the first time my brother did this kind of hacking.  There were some
problems when he tried without thoroughly understanding the process but
luckily, everything went just as smooth as expected.  We started from Saturday
night til Sunday afternoon.  I gave him advice as he did the real job.  At the
end of the long session, I asked him to note everything he did and blog about
his experience but he seemed to be out of interest :-).  So I just go ahead
and write.</p>
