Learn yourself a tool and master it.  Whether you totally love it or not, it should be the tool you feel most comfortable working with.  I always have [problems with choices](http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice.html) when it comes to tool.  There are so many tools to choose, and *obviously* no tool is perfect, not to even mention my personal taste.

I *always* have problems choosing a programming language to write some piece of software, unless someone forces me to, of course, with uneasy feelings.  The language itself, the paradigms it provides and how to implement one beautifully yet performance is preserved, coding convention and default (standard) library (which, by the way the point I hate the most about Python), availability of external libraries and support, internal and external maintainability, ...  There are plenty of things to consider, and I couldn't find, or rather haven't found, a combination I totally fell in love with.  Programming is **art**, but unlike art, perfection doesn't exist.  Perfectionism needs to be practical, not to give up the quest of seeking for complete beauty, but to survive in the imperfect world.

Off we go.  I decide to give Ruby, LiveScript & JavaScript, and Haskell my whole heart, at least, for a couple years from now.
