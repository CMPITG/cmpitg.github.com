The old year has just passed, a Lunar new year has just come.  Though a 3-hour
sleep is bad for the heart, it couldn't stop my brain from calling myself up
in the early morning to plan and write something for the new year.  Fresh air,
dark sky, with a gently touch of winter on the first day, too good to get
started.

I have deep care for productivity and spend lots of time tweaking my
environment.
[UNIX-HATERS handbook](http://wayback.archive.org/web/20120120031001/http://m.simson.net/ugh.pdf)
surely seeds some kind of rebellious thoughts in my mindset, which constantly
reminds me of analyzing my workflow everyday.  Recently, I've been playing
around with Racket and note down the most common tasks I do regularly, which
in turn encourages me to write [my ideal system page](/random/ideal-system/).
At the moment, it's a bunch of fragmented ideas.  When an idea is formed well
enough, I'll go ahead and implement it using my
[literate programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
[tool](https://github.com/cmpitg/ulquikit) and experiment on my own.

Default Markdown renderer on Github (Redcarpet I think) doesn't handle deeply
nested list well, see the
[source file](https://github.com/cmpitg/cmpitg.github.com/blob/master/random/ideal-system.md)
for the original version.
