While reading [ElementaryOS journal](http://elementaryos.org/journal) I found a short but interesting entry about the [10x10 design process](http://elementaryos.org/journal/design-process).  Gotta write it down for myself to remember and for future reference.  The process was stated as below:

<blockquote>
<p>Whenever you encounter a design problem:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Sketch ten designs that each solve your problem in a distinct or different way.</li>
    <li>Get feedback from your peers, friends, coworkers etc.</li>
    <li>Take the favorite few designs and sketch ten variations of each.</li>
    <li>Get feedback on each of those.</li>
    <li>Choose the one you now feel works the best.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

The main purposes of this process are:

* 10x10 (or 100) might place you beyond your limit and **force** you to come up with **innovative** ideas

* It gets you truly thinking about the *design problem rather than a single design solution*
