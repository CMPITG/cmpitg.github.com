My purpose of doing Gokien:

* Improving Ubuntu technical stuff

* *Improving Ubuntu development model*, I have tons of negative personal experiences with Ubuntu and Canonical.  Fedora's development model is the best in my perspective.

* Bringing modern look and feel to desktop environment without sacrificing performance

So why not Fedora?

* Unstable - Can't blame Fedora Project and community on this.  It's a trade-off for "Feature & First" (Fedora's four Fs)

* I *deeply* hate *yum* and *RPM*, logically.  I won't explain right it here, since itself's worth another entry

Rules:

* Always use the long-term-support version of Ubuntu
* Follow good [HCI guideline](_)
* Apply the best of Fedora & Debian development models
