My name is *Nguyễn Hà Dương*, also known as Duong “Yang” Nguyen in English, グ
エンヤン in Japanese, and simply *cmpitg*. Please call me "Yang" if you don't
want to pronounce the word :-). I'm a
[FOSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_Open_Source_Software) activist in
Vietnam, where I do software development, promote the sharing culture and
provide support for both users and contributors. I'm a greedy person with a
wide range of interest in FOSS projects: Mozilla (as a
[Mozilla Rep](https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Cmpitg)), Fedora (also as
[Fedora Ambassador](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Cmpitg)), Node.js,
SpiderMonkey, ...

Besides being a member of some FOSS communities (which of course you don't
want me to miss HanoiLUG), I and a bunch of FOSS guys have founded
[Hanoi Community Space](http://khonggiancongdong.org) - a FOSS working group
and community model to promote the **philosophy and culture** of Free and Open
Source Software, as well as to **bring value** to anyone who is a part of the
ecosystem - in in
March 2012. [Join us](https://groups.google.com/group/khonggian-congdong) if
you are interested!

To make my life more thrilled, I have developed
[RSI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury) since
July 2012. My life as a computer addict has never been more annoying. Oh well,
it's a hack after all.

## In Programming

I collect programming languages as my hobby. I love and strongly believe in
the art of designing programs. No matter how difficult a problem is,
*programmers should always be the masters*.

## In Other IT Stuff

I am a hardcore GNU/Linux system administrator. The first time I used
GNU/Linux was in 2005, when I received a Ubuntu CD freely distributed in my
school. I officially changed from Microsoft Windows® to GNU/Linux in 2008 and
tried as many \*nix distributions as I can.

- In 2005: Ubuntu
- From mid 2005 to mid 2006: Slackware and Fedora
- In second half of 2006: Debian GNU/Linux
- From 2007 to mid 2008: openSUSE and Fedora
- From 2009 to 2012: FreeBSD, Ubuntu
- From 2009 to present (2012): Fedora
- From early 2010 to Jun 2011: Arch Linux
- From early 2010 to the end of 2011, 2012 to present (2014): Debian GNU/Linux
  as my main system.
- From mid 2010 to Jun 2011: OpenBSD
- From mid 2010 to 2012: Gentoo GNU/Linux.

I’m a language, keyboard, and typeface lover. I speak Vietnamese (native),
English (fluent), French (intermediate), Japanese (intermediate), and a bit of
Spanish. I used to be an advanced Vim user but officially changed to Emacs in
2010 when I found Vim did not fit all my need. I’m left-handed and a loyal
Programmer Dvorak user.

I'm a fan of a barebone window manager with pluggable desktop components,
rather than a bloated desktop environment.  2012 was the year I tried various
[dynamic window managers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_window_manager)
including [dwm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwm),
[Awesome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awesome_(window_manager)), and
[Xmonad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xmonad).  Among all, Awesome was the
nicest with the powerful Lua configuration, rich features and wide range of
libraries, and I used it for the longest period of time.  However, as my needs
grew, my Awesome config became cluttered and tedious to manage.  With
recommendation from [@myguidingstar](https://github.com/myguidingstar/), I
tried [i3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/i3_(window_manager)) and immediately
sticked with it since then.
