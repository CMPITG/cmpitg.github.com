{% include JB/setup %}

My name is Ha-Duong Nguyen, also known as *cmpitg*.  I'm a
[Free and Open Source Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_Open_Source_Software)
(FOSS) activist, software architect, and problem solver who believes in
practical results, beautiful implementation with simplicity, solidity and high
productivity.

In software development, I rock with
[Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp) and I'm fluent with
other 13 programming languages.  I love programming with a passion and love
how languages sharp the way we think and solve problems.

<!-- Besides being a member of some FOSS communities (which of course you don't -->
<!-- want me to miss [HanoiLUG](http://lists.hanoilug.org/listinfo)), I and a bunch -->
<!-- of FOSS guys have founded -->
<!-- [Hanoi Community Space](http://khonggiancongdong.org) - a FOSS working group -->
<!-- and community model to promote the **philosophy and culture** of Free and Open -->
<!-- Source Software, as well as to **bring value** to anyone who is a part of the -->
<!-- ecosystem - in -->
<!-- March 2012. [Join us](https://groups.google.com/group/khonggian-congdong) if -->
<!-- you are interested! -->

To make my life more thrilled, I have developed
[RSI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury) since July 2012.
My life as a computer addict has never been more excitingly annoying.

<!-- ## In Programming -->

<!-- I collect programming languages as my hobby. I love and strongly believe in -->
<!-- the art of designing programs. No matter how bad a language is, *programmers -->
<!-- should always be be its masters*. -->

<!-- ### Programming Style -->

<!-- Clean, concise, functional-style code **and documentation**.  Find -->
<!-- [me](https://github.com/cmpitg) on Github.  Did I mention that I'm a huge fan -->
<!-- of [literate programming](http://www.literateprogramming.com/)? -->

<!-- ## In Other IT-related Work -->

<!-- I am a hardcore GNU/Linux system administrator. The first time I used -->
<!-- GNU/Linux was in 2005, when I received a Ubuntu CD freely distributed in my -->
<!-- school. I abandoned Micro$oft Windows® and moved (without a trace) to -->
<!-- GNU/Linux in 2008 and tried as many \*nix distributions as I can. -->

<!-- - In 2005: Ubuntu -->
<!-- - From mid 2005 to mid 2006: Slackware and Fedora -->
<!-- - In second half of 2006: Debian GNU/Linux -->
<!-- - From 2007 to mid 2008: openSUSE (and briefly Fedora in 2007) -->
<!-- - From 2009 to 2010: FreeBSD -->
<!-- - From 2010 to 2012: Ubuntu -->
<!-- - From 2009 to present (2014): Fedora -->
<!-- - From early 2010 to Jun 2010: Arch Linux -->
<!-- - From Jun 2010 to 2012: Gentoo GNU/Linux. -->
<!-- - From early 2010 to the end of 2011, 2012 to present (2014): Debian GNU/Linux -->
<!--   as my main system. -->

<!-- I’m a language, keyboard, and typeface lover. I speak Vietnamese (native), -->
<!-- English (fluent), French (intermediate), Japanese (intermediate), and a bit of -->
<!-- Spanish. I used to be an advanced Vim user but officially changed to Emacs in -->
<!-- 2010 when I found Vim did not fit all my need. I’m a loyal Programmer Dvorak -->
<!-- user. -->

<!-- I'm a fan of a barebone window manager with pluggable desktop components, -->
<!-- rather than a bloated desktop environment.  2012 was the year I tried various -->
<!-- [dynamic window managers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_window_manager) -->
<!-- including [dwm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwm), -->
<!-- [Awesome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awesome_(window_manager)), and -->
<!-- [Xmonad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xmonad).  Among all, Awesome was the -->
<!-- nicest with the powerful Lua configuration, rich features and wide range of -->
<!-- libraries.  I used it for the longest period of time.  However, as my needs -->
<!-- grew, my Awesome config became cluttered and tedious to manage.  With -->
<!-- recommendation from [@myguidingstar](https://github.com/myguidingstar/), I -->
<!-- tried [i3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/i3_(window_manager)) and immediately -->
<!-- sticked with it since then. -->
